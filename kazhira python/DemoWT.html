<p>
<h2>
ARCHIDAMUS
</h2>
If
you
shall
chance
,
Camillo
,
to
visit
Bohemia
on
the
like
occasion
whereon
my
services
are
now
on
foot
,
you
shall
see
,
as
I
have
said
,
great
difference
betwixt
our
Bohemia
and
your
Sicilia
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
CAMILLO
</h2>
I
think
this
coming
summer
the
King
of
Sicilia
means
to
pay
Bohemia
the
visitation
which
he
justly
owes
him
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
ARCHIDAMUS
</h2>
Wherein
our
entertainment
shall
shame
us
;
we
will
be
justified
in
our
loves
.
For
indeed
</p>
<p>
<h2>
CAMILLO
</h2>
Beseech
you
</p>
<p>
<h2>
ARCHIDAMUS
</h2>
Verily
,
I
speak
it
in
the
freedom
of
my
knowledge
.
We
cannot
with
such
magnificence
in
so
rare
I
know
not
what
to
say
.
We
will
give
you
sleepy
drinks
,
that
your
senses
,
unintelligent
of
our
insufficience
,
may
,
though
they
cannot
praise
us
,
as
little
accuse
us
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
CAMILLO
</h2>
You
pay
a
great
deal
too
dear
for
what’s
given
freely
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
ARCHIDAMUS
</h2>
Believe
me
,
I
speak
as
my
understanding
instructs
me
and
as
mine
honesty
puts
it
to
utterance
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
CAMILLO
</h2>
Sicilia
cannot
show
himself
overkind
to
Bohemia
.
They
were
trained
together
in
their
childhoods
,
and
there
rooted
betwixt
them
then
such
an
affection
which
cannot
choose
but
branch
now
.
Since
their
more
mature
dignities
and
royal
necessities
made
separation
of
their
society
,
their
encounters
,
though
not
personal
,
hath
been
royally
attorneyed
with
interchange
of
gifts
,
letters
,
loving
embassies
,
that
they
have
seemed
to
be
together
though
absent
,
shook
hands
as
over
a
vast
,
and
embraced
as
it
were
from
the
ends
of
opposed
winds
.
The
heavens
continue
their
loves
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
ARCHIDAMUS
</h2>
I
think
there
is
not
in
the
world
either
malice
or
matter
to
alter
it
.
You
have
an
unspeakable
comfort
of
your
young
Prince
Mamillius
.
It
is
a
gentleman
of
the
greatest
promise
that
ever
came
into
my
note
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
CAMILLO
</h2>
I
very
well
agree
with
you
in
the
hopes
of
him
.
It
is
a
gallant
child
one
that
indeed
physics
the
subject
,
makes
old
hearts
fresh
.
They
that
went
on
crutches
ere
he
was
born
desire
yet
their
life
to
see
him
a
man
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
ARCHIDAMUS
</h2>
Would
they
else
be
content
to
die
?
</p>
<p>
<h2>
CAMILLO
</h2>
Yes
,
if
there
were
no
other
excuse
why
they
should
desire
to
live
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
ARCHIDAMUS
</h2>
If
the
King
had
no
son
,
they
would
desire
to
live
on
crutches
till
he
had
one
.
</p>
<h4>
They
exit
.

Nine
changes
of
the
wat’ry
star
hath
been
The
shepherd’s
note
since
we
have
left
our
throne
Without
a
burden
.
Time
as
long
again
Would
be
filled
up
,
my
brother
,
with
our
thanks
,
And
yet
we
should
for
perpetuity
Go
hence
in
debt
.
And
therefore
,
like
a
cipher
,
Yet
standing
in
rich
place
,
I
multiply
With
one
We
thank
you
many
thousands
more
That

<h2>
POLIXENES
</h2>
Sir
,
that’s
tomorrow
.
I
am
questioned
by
my
fears
of
what
may
chance
Or
breed
upon
our
absence
,
that
may
blow
No
sneaping
winds
at
home
to
make
us
say
This
is
put
forth
too
truly
.
Besides
,
I
have
stayed
To
tire
your
Royalty
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
LEONTES

We
are
tougher

Than

</p>
<p>
<h2>
POLIXENES

No
longer
stay

<p>
<h2>
LEONTES

One
sev’nnight

<p>
<h2>
POLIXENES

Very
sooth
,
tomorrow
.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
LEONTES

We’ll
part
the
time
between

then
,
and
in
that
I’ll
no
gainsaying

Press

There
is
no

none

So
soon
as
yours
could
win
me
.
So
it
should
now
,
Were
there
necessity
in
your
request
,
although
’Twere
needful
I
denied
it
.
My
affairs
Do
even
drag
me
homeward

hinder
Were

<h2>
HERMIONE

I
had
thought
,
sir
,
to
have
held
my
peace
until
You
had
drawn
oaths
from
him
not

You
,

Charge
him
too
coldly

Tell

All

This
satisfaction
The

But
let
him
say
so
then
,
and
let
him
go
.
But
let
him
swear
so
and
he
shall
not
stay

We’ll
thwack
him
hence
with
distaffs

Yet
of

When

You
